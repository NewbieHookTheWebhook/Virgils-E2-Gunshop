# Installation

Installing is quite easy, simply:

Create a box for your shipment(s)

Add a User and a Ranger in your box

Make sure the ranger's length is small enough so it doesn't mistake the box for your shipment.

Connect the User's Fire output to UseB1 for your first shipment

Connect the User's Fire output to UseB2 for your second shipment

Connect the E2's EGP (wirelink) and User(entity) to the EGP screen

Connect the E2's Stock1 output to the Ranger's Range for your first shipment

Connect the E2's Stock2 output to the Ranger's Range for your second shipment

Stock your shipments, adjust the E2, and have fun!
